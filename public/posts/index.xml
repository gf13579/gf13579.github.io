      <description>A SIEM typically collects event data, runs detections, generates alerts and serves as a single pane of glass for security alerts. One of the fundamental types of event to ingest is malware alerts from endpoint antivirus and EDR solutions. Malware alerts may seem dull - no user behaviour analytics, no machine learning, but we very often read incident response reports where an attacker triggered AV/EDR alerts that were completely ignored, before eventually executing a ransomware attack or exfiltrating data.</description>
